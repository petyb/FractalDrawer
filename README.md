# FractalDrawer
This is a Windows Forms C# app, which renders fractal using Mandelbrot set. Also there is a feature of zooming into the fractal

## Zooming
If you select a certain area, the fractal will be redrawn:

You can keep doing it infinitely

To change the form of fractal, you can change variable `c` in the code. In comments there are several values that generate other beautiful fractals.
